is a simple and fast ASN.1 decoder without external libraries designed 
to parse large files.

Another widely used library for encoding and decoding ASN.1 in python is
http://pyasn1.sourceforge.net/[Pyasn1 ].  This implementation covers many
aspects of ASN.1, but the API is very complex and hard to learn.  Furthermore
Pyasn1 is not designed to parse large files.  This why I wrote this tiny ASN.1
decoder.  It's design goal was to be as fast as possible (the original
version was implemented in Python 2, then ported to the present version for 
Python 3).


A practical application can be found in 
<<Search serial in large certificate revocation lists>>:
This program creates an index allowing fast search in big ASN.1 data
structures.

The source code is hosted on https://github.com/getreu/asn1-tiny-decoder[Github].




== The ASN.1 decoder 


=== Decoder API

The decoder API consists of 7 functions documented below.

.ASN.1 node

In link:https://blog.getreu.net/_downloads/asn1-tiny-decoder.zip[`asn1tinydecoder.py`] a "`node`" is a pointer to an 
ASN.1 chunk of Bytes containing 3 parts:

     [type Byte, length Bytes, value Bytes] 

A node represented by a Python tuple:

     (ixs, ixf, ixl)
     

`ixs`:: Points to the type Byte which is the first Byte of the chunk.
`ixf`:: Points to the first value Byte.
`ixl`:: Points to the last value Byte which is the last Byte of the 
        chunk.

.Navigate

In order to browse through ASN.1 tree structures you need only
3 functions to navigate:

NOTE: All functions of link:https://blog.getreu.net/_downloads/asn1-tiny-decoder.zip[`asn1tinydecoder.py`] are stateless.  



`asn1_node_root()`:: Points to the first node in the tree structure. 
This is the root node.
`asn1_node_next()`:: Skips and points to the next node. 
`asn1_node_first_child()`:: Opens a ASN.1 _sequence_ or _set_ and points 
          to the first node inside the _sequence_ or _set_.  

.Control loops


`asn1_node_is_child_of()`:: Controls loops over lists
i.e. _sequence_ or _set_. 
It returns `true` if one ASN.1 chunk is inside another chunk.
footnote:[The function tests if the two nodes are in a parent-child or
grand parent-child relation. The order of the two parameters does not 
matter.]  
See example in function `extract_crl_info()` in 
<<ASN.1 decoder usage example>>. 




.Accessing node's data  +
Once you found the right node you can access the node's data with:


`asn1_get_value()`:: Gets the bytestring of value Bytes of the pointed node.
WARNING: There is no check if the node contains the data type you expect. 
If you can please use `asn1_get_value_of_type()` instead.

`asn1_get_value_of_type()`:: Same as the above, but first checks
	if the pointed node is of a given type.
	Recognized types are: 	
	`BOOLEAN`, 
	`INTEGER`, 
	`BIT STRING`,        
	`OCTET STRING`,      
	`NULL`,              
	`OBJECT IDENTIFIER`, 
	`SEQUENCE`,          
	`SET`,               
	`PrintableString`,   
	`IA5String`,         
	`UTCTime`,        
	`ENUMERATED`,
	`UTF8String`, 
	`PrintableString`.
`asn1_get_all()`:: Gets the bytes of the whole node i.e. type Byte, 
length Bytes and value Bytes in one string.

NOTE: All data is returned in raw format exactly as it is stored in the
ASN.1 chunk. You need to convert it yourself.
footnote:[The most commonly used converters `bitstr_to_bytes()`
and `bytestr_to_int` are provided by 
link:https://blog.getreu.net/_downloads/asn1-tiny-decoder.zip[`asn1tinydecoder.py`].]

== ASN.1 decoder usage example

CRL lists can be hundreds of MB long. The (otherwise very good) 
http://pyasn1.sourceforge.net/[ASN.1 python library] 
takes hours to run through such large structures. 
`asn1tinydecoder` does the same in some seconds.

See the source code below for examples how the 
decoder can be used. 


[[search-serial]]
=== Search serial in large certificate revocation lists


link:/_downloads/asn1-tiny-decoder.zip[`search_serial_in_large_CRL.py`]
searches serials in large CRLs.

It runs through large ASN.1 structures creating an index
dictionary `serials_idx`. There it saves certificate serials and 
pointers to corresponding certificate data chunks 
(see function `extract_crl_info()`).

The dictionary is then used to determine
if a given serial is revoked or not. This index allows fast search.

The function `search_certificate()` prints out the corresponding 
revoked certificate data.

.Performance

Indexing a 19MB CRL with 266616 certificates takes less then 6 seconds 
on my netbook with _AMD E-450_ CPU.
